# Virtual Mall
Its a VB.NET project that simulates a shopping mall experience for a single user. The project includes different sections such as games,
shopping, movie tickets booking, and restaurant reservations, which are organized in a user-friendly interface. The project uses a database

for movie tickets and restaurant reservations, using an API to retrieve real-time data. The project requires testing, refining, deployment, 
and maintenance to ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience.
